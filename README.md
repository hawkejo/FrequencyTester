# FrequencyTester

Code for computing a frequency and a test program.

This code provided is a staging area for designing various methods to compute a frequency and test the effectiveness and 
accuracy of those computation methods.  The following classes are defined here:

FFTFreqGen: Computes a frequency using Discrete Fourier Transforms an the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm

The following interface allows for changing between any of the above classes easily:
